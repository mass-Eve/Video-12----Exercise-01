There are a bunch of ways in which we can improve our prorgams.

But it is important to know why improvisations are important?
01. To me personally, I believe that there is always a scope for improvisations.
02. We may need improvisations to 
    
    a) improve the working of our program.
    b) improve the existing functionalities of our programs.
    c) introduce new functionalities in our programs.
        Sometimes, at the time of writing the code we may think that this is enough for this program. But later on, we might get some new ideas that we can integrate in our program to improve its working and area of scope.
    d) improve the error and exceptions handling capabilties of our programs.
        Sometimes, we are in hurry and don't really look at the error and exceptions handling capabilities of our programs. As we have already saw in our past programs that we occasionally get error for something we can't even control. For example -- Data type error: when an unexpected data type's value is given by the programmer.
        In these moments, we need to work on improving the errors and exceptions handling capabilities of our program so as to improve the area of working or scope of our programs.
