Syntax Of print() function

    print("data to to shown in output is written here, which is enclosed within double quotations or single quotations")

Note -> There are several parameter that can also be written inside a print() function, but it is out of scope write now. It is discussed in the upcoming lessons.

Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code. In many other programming languages, Indentation is used for just increasing the readability of the code, but in case of python, Indentation plays a vital and important role in the codebase as it denotes a block of code. And yeah also it contributes in readability of the code as well.

What if I don't give indentations?
In such case, an Indentation Error will be generated.

Comments?
Comments are some special line of codes of code blocks which are written for the programmer itself. These lines though included in the code but they are not interpreted as code and they are not run by the interpreter. They are written for future references or for other programmers to enable them to understand the code easily.
In python, there are two types of comments.
Single Line Comments | Multiple Line Comments
Single Line Comments are decalred either using pound symbol or a hash (#) Or by a pair of triple single quotes

    # This is a single line comment
    ''' This is also a single line comment '''

Multiple Line Comments are declared using triple single quotes.

    ''' 
    This is a multiple line comment
    '''
