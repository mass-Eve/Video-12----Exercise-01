A print() function is used to print the data on the terminal screen

Syntax Of print() function

    print("data to to shown in output is written here, which is enclosed within double quotations or single quotations")

Note -> There are several parameter that can also be written inside a print() function, but it is out of scope write now. It is discussed in the upcoming lessons.

Indentation

    Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code. In many other programming languages, Indentation is used for just increasing the readability of the code, but in case of python, Indentation plays a vital and important role in the codebase as it denotes a block of code. And yeah, it also contributes in the readability of the code as well.

    What if I don't give indentations?
    In such case, an Indentation Error will be generated.

Comments

    Comments are some special line of codes or code blocks which are written for the programmer itself. These lines though included in the code but they are not interpreted as code and they are not run by the interpreter. They are written for future references or for other programmers to enable them to understand the code easily.

### Declaring Comments

In python, there are two types of comments.

Single Line Comments | Multiple Line Comments

    Single Line Comments are decalred either using pound symbol or a hash (#) Or by a pair of triple single quotes
    
    # This is a single line comment
    ''' This is also a single line comment '''

---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Multiple Line Comments are declared using triple single quotes.

    ''' 
    This is a multiple line comment
    '''

Python Character Set

    A character set is a set of valid characters acceptable by a programming language in scripting.

Token

    A token is the smallest individual unit in a python program. All statements and instructions in a program are built with tokens.

Tokens in python are classified in the following ~

01. Keywords

        Keywords can be defined as words that are identified specially by a programming language, words that have a special meaning pre-defined in that programming language. 

        They can’t be used as variable names, function names, or any other random purpose. 
        
        They are used for their special features. 

        In Python we have 33 keywords in total.

02. Identifiers

        Identifiers are the name (or unique-identification) given to user-defined customs like variables, functions etc.. whose meaning and functionality are decided by the programmer.

        Since Python is a case-sensitive language, it has some rules and regulations to name an identifier. 
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Here are some rules to name an identifier:-

        a) Python is case-sensitive. So the case in which the identification is written matters in naming the identifiers. And hence ankur and Ankur are two different identifiers.

        b) They can either start from lower-case-alphabets or upper-case-alphabets. 

        c) No identifier should start with a number or a special character.

        d) A integer is allowed in between the name of the idetifier, but the identifier itself cannot start with a number.
            Example -> num1 ✅ || 1num❌

        e) The only special character that is allowed in the names of an identifier is underscore (_)

        f) An identifier can't be a keyword.

03. Literals

        Literals are the items that have a fixed value in a python-script.
    
        There are different types of literals in python ~ 

        a). String Literals
        
        b). Numeric Literals
        
        c). Boolean Literals
        
        d). Special Literals

04. Operators & Operands

        Operators are the tokens which are used to perform arithmatic calculations.
        They can be unary or binary.

        Operands are the variables or the values on which the operation happens.
    
        a) Unary Operators

            They act on a single operand.

        b) Binary Operators

            They require atleast two operands.

05. Punctuators

        These are the tokens (or symbols) that are used in Python to organize the structures, statements, and expressions. 
        Some of the Punctuators are: [ ] { } ( ) @  -=  +=  *=  //=  **==  = , etc.

<!-- Variables & Their Declaration

    Variables are containers for storing values belonging to a data type.
    Since python is dynamically type, we need not to declare the type of the data type that variable is going to store (the thing we do in languages like C!).

    To decalre a variable, we first write the name or unique-identification of that variable followed by a equal to sign and then the value that we want to store.
Example -:
    <var-name> = value
Note -> The values should only be assigned from the rigt side. -->
